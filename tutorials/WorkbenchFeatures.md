**Share Diagram**  

* You can generate a link to share your diagram with your team mates without sign in.  
  An interesting usage of Azure properties is that the diagram with Azure properties entered can be explicitly shown and discuss.
* After you sign in, the diagram you share can be loaded from My Space, any changes you make to  share diagram, the link recipient can see updates.  
  This feature significantly limits the number of links to the same diagram you may need to share.

**Export diagram as PDF**  

There are 2 ways to save diagram as PDF
* Workbench "Export as PDF"
* Use Browser Print feature:  
  First "Export diagram as SVG", then open "diagram.svg" in browser and trigger a Print,
  choose "Save-PDF" and click Save.  

**Export diagram .azwb file**  

This is Workbench's diagram format, editing content of this file strongly discouraged.  
.azwb file can be imported by dragging onto canvas or through Import menu

**Drag files onto Canvas**  

 You can drag any PNG, SVG or .azwb files onto canvas.  
*Note: Image file cannot be larger than 400Kb.

**Save to browser**  

Ctrl+S saves diagram to Browser's localstorage.  
You can only save 1 copy, subsequent saving overrides the previous copy.                
     
**My Space**  

This is your personal space to store and manage your diagrams on Workbench,  
but you have to sign in using your Azure AD work account for this goodness.
