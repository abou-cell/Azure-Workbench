# Workbench Features

**Export diagram as PDF**  

There are 2 ways to save diagram as PDF
* Workbench "Export as PDF"
* Use Browser Print feature:  
  First "Export diagram as SVG", then open "diagram.svg" in browser and trigger a Print,
  choose "Save-PDF" and click Save.  

**Export diagram .azwb file**  

This is Workbench's diagram format, editing this Json file in text editor is strongly discouraged.  
.azwb file can be imported by dragging onto canvas or through Import menu

**Drag files onto Canvas**  

 You can drag any PNG, SVG or .azwb files onto canvas.  
*Note: Image file cannot be larger than 400Kb.

**Share Diagram**  

You can generate a link to share your diagram with your team mates without sign in.  
Even if you don't plan to deploy diagrams to your subscription,  
you can still input Azure Properties for each Azure node and share diagram.  
In this way, Azure configuration properties can be explicitly shown and discuss rather than  

**Save to browser**  

Ctrl+S saves diagram to Browser's localstorage.  
You can only save 1 copy, subsequent saving overrides the previous copy.                
     
**My Space**  

This is your personal space to store and manage your diagrams on Workbench,  
but you have to sign in using your Azure AD work account for this goodness.
